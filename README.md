Please note that the Twilio Client Android SDK is superseded by the newer Twilio Programmable Voice 
Android SDK, which uses GCM push notifications for signaling incoming calls. Please see our announcement 
for background information on this change and consult the Programmable Voice SDK documentation for 
technical details. In addition, please refer to [getting-started](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/android/getting-started) documentation and [voice-quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-android) application.
