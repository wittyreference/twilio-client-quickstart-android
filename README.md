# *IMPORTANT*

+Twilio Client platform SDK has been deprecated in favor of Twilio's Programmable Voice Android SDK which is now GA and uses GCM/FCM push notifications for signaling incoming calls; for more information about the benefits of moving to push notifications see our [blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/09/beta-programmable-voice-sdk-for-ios-with-support-for-voip-services-push-notifications.html) on the motivation behind the change.
+
+Twilio recommends all new development use the Programmable Voice SDK as the Client SDKs will soon be end-of-life. Programmable Voice SDK documentation can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/android).
